1. To access your Windows D drive from your virtual Linux machine, you can use VirtualBox's shared folder feature. Follow these steps:

Install VirtualBox Guest Additions:

Make sure your virtual machine is running.

In the VirtualBox menu, click on "Devices" and select "Insert Guest Additions CD image."

This action will mount a virtual CD inside your virtual machine.

Open a terminal on your Linux machine and navigate to the CD directory.

Create a Shared Folder:

1. In VirtualBox, select your virtual machine and click on "Settings."
2. Go to the "Shared Folders" tab.
3. Click on the folder icon with a plus sign to add a new shared folder.
4. Choose your D drive (or any other folder you want to share) as the folder path.
5. Enter a name for the shared folder (e.g., D_drive).
6. Check the "Auto-mount" option if you want the shared folder to be automatically mounted on startup.
7. Click "OK" to save the settings.

Mount the Shared Folder on Linux:

Open a terminal on your Linux machine.

Create a directory where you want to mount the shared folder.
```bash
mkdir ~/shared
```
Mount the shared folder.
```bash
sudo mount -t vboxsf D_drive ~/shared
```
Now, you should be able to access the contents of your Windows D drive in the ~/shared directory on your Linux machine.

Automatically Mount the Shared Folder on Boot:

To automatically mount the shared folder on boot, you can add an entry to the /etc/fstab file.

Open /etc/fstab in a text editor.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
Add the following line at the end of the file.

```bash
D_drive  /home/yourusername/shared  vboxsf  defaults  0  0
```
Replace yourusername with your Linux username.

Save the file and exit the text editor.

Restart your virtual machine to apply the changes.
